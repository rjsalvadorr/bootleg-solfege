# Bootleg Solfege Exercises

I made a whole set of solfege exercise MP3s, so I can practice some ear training without playing an instrument. And even do some listening while on the subway, or something.

## Build/Assembly

1. Compile the Lilypond files, which will output PDF and MIDI files for use.
2. The MIDI files can be used as-is, though it's best to use them on a DAW for better control over sound quality

## Dependencies

- Lilypond

I wrote this on a Windows platform, though the `*.ly` files should work the same way anywhere.
