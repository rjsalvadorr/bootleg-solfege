# Bootleg Solfege Exercises

I made a whole set of solfege exercise MP3s, so I can practice some ear training without playing an instrument. And even do some listening while on the subway, or something.

## Build/Assembly

1. Compile the Lilypond files, which will output PDF and MIDI files for use.
2. The MIDI files can be used as-is, though it's best to use them on a DAW for better control over sound quality

## Dependencies

The scripts are written for Python 3!

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Lilypond](http://lilypond.org/)
- [eSpeak](http://espeak.sourceforge.net/)
